Futhark is a purely functional data-parallel programming language in
the ML family.  It can be compiled to typically very efficient
parallel code, running on either a CPU or GPU.  The language is
developed at [DIKU](http://diku.dk) at the University of Copenhagen,
originally as part of the [HIPERFIT centre](http://hiperfit.dk).  It
is quite stable and suitable for practical programming.

Hacking
=======

We welcome all contributions!

Issues tagged with [good first
issue](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
do not require deep knowledge of the code base.

For contributing code, see also [the style guide](STYLE.md).

SO WHAT IS THIS?
================
This is the Metal branch of Futhark, a version of Futhark which culls OpenCL/CUDA and implements Metal support for Apple/Mac GPUs
enabling Futhark to compile in the OS X ecosystem. There are a lot of features planned for this branch, some of which are addressed below but an exhaustive list is in progress. Below is also a collection of writing about the experience, goals, and milestones; any help is appreciated as it's currently maintained by just me (Miles J. Litteral/SasoriZero) but I look forward to showing you the progress!

Current Working Version: v0.0.2(Alpha)
Past Versions: v0.0.1(Pre-Alpha)

Gists on the Project(Planning, theory, How Metal is Different from CUDA/OpenCL, the Method/Mechanisms behind Futhark-Metal that make it possible):

Keep an eye out for/on the mlir llvm branch which is coming soon!
I have plans to also tackle the Vulkan Branch at some point (currently stale, long-term future) 

Roadmap
=======
## Step 0

* Connect mtlpp or metal-cpp to Futhark Where it can see main library header (mtlpp.hpp choosen) ‚úîÔ∏è

* Make Proof of Concept experiments in Metal demonstrating Objective-C++ and how it can be used
For Futhark's purposes, in this case, potential use-cases (mtlAdder, mtlDot, mtlLib, mtlRenderer) ‚úîÔ∏è

* Build MetalEngine Class based off this research, implement as main mechanism of Futhark-Metal ‚úîÔ∏è

## Step 1

* Create and Implmement Futhark.Backend.Metal and all necessary Haskell Code (2/20/22)‚úîÔ∏è

* Build/Compile Prototypes of Futhark-Metal (v001/v002) ‚úîÔ∏è 

## Step 2

* Stress Test Prototypes <- You are Here!(3/1/22) üîµ

* Refine Output Code of Prototypes ‚úñÔ∏è

* Implement build flags (Metal Script, Metallib, MetalDyLib) ‚úñÔ∏è

* Unreliable Output ‚úñÔ∏è

## Release

* Feature Parity with Futhark OpenCL/CUDA       ‚úñÔ∏è

* Platform agnostic creation of Metallib/DyLib  ‚úñÔ∏è

* Reliable Output   ‚úñÔ∏è


## Optional
Futhask-Metal

MoltenVK/MoltenGL bridge:
MVKCreateInstance
MVKBuffer
MVKPipeline
MVKExecuteOn

Platform-Free Execution (subject to being removed potentially, depends on how development goes)
Quartz++
